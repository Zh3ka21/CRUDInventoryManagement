Inventory Management System

Creating an inventory management system using Python Flask and MongoDB is a great project that combines backend development, database management, and web development. Here’s a comprehensive guide to what should be included in your project and some ideas to get you started:
Key Features to Include:

    User Authentication and Authorization:
        Sign Up/Login: Allow users to create accounts and login.

        Add/Update/Delete Products: Forms and functionality to manage products.
        Product Details: Display detailed information about each product.
        Product Categories: Categorize products for easier management and retrieval.

    Inventory Tracking:
        Stock Levels: Track the quantity of each product in stock.
        Low Stock Alerts: Notify when stock falls below a certain threshold.
        Stock In/Out: Record stock additions and deductions with timestamps.

    Order Management:
        Create Orders: Process new orders, updating inventory accordingly.
        Order History: Maintain a history of all orders placed.
        Order Status: Track the status of each order (e.g., pending, shipped, delivered).

        Sales Reports: Generate reports on sales over various periods. (Graphics for each product to see its growth)
        Inventory Reports: Generate reports on inventory levels and movements.
        User Activity Reports: Track user interactions with the system. (Maybe time spent, some reviews)

    Search and Filter:
        Search Products: Allow users to search for products by name, category, etc.
        Filter Products: Provide filtering options based on various criteria.

    ############# MUST BE DONE ################
    User Interface:
        Dashboard: Provide an overview of key metrics (e.g., total products, low stock items).
        Responsive Design: Ensure the application works well on different devices.
        Intuitive Navigation: Easy-to-use navigation structure.

Technical Implementation:

    Backend (Flask):
        Setup Flask Application: Create a basic Flask app structure.
        Routes and Views: Define routes for different functionalities (e.g., product management, order management).
        RESTful API: Create API endpoints for frontend-backend communication.
        Authentication: Implement JWT or session-based authentication.
        Error Handling: Handle and log errors gracefully.

    Database (MongoDB):
        Schema Design: Define collections and documents for products, users, orders, etc.
        Indexing: Implement indexes to optimize query performance.
        CRUD Operations: Implement Create, Read, Update, Delete operations for different collections.

    Frontend:
        Templates: Use Jinja2 templates to render dynamic HTML.
        Forms: Create forms for user inputs (e.g., product addition, order creation).
        JavaScript: Enhance user experience with JavaScript (e.g., form validation, asynchronous requests).

    Deployment:
        Server Setup: Configure a server (e.g., AWS, Heroku) to host the application.
        Database Configuration: Set up a remote MongoDB instance (e.g., MongoDB Atlas).
        Environment Variables: Securely manage configuration settings using environment variables.
        Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD): Automate deployment processes.

    Test:
        Test database.

    

Additional Features:

    Barcode Scanning:
        Integrate barcode scanning for quick product identification and management.

    Notifications:
        Email or SMS notifications for low stock alerts, order confirmations, etc.

    Supplier Management:
        Manage suppliers and purchase orders for restocking inventory.

    Multi-Language Support:
        Provide support for multiple languages to cater to a broader audience.

    Audit Logs:
        Maintain logs of all changes made to the inventory for auditing purposes.
